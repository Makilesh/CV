# Peripheral — Results

Every number here was measured on the machine described below. Nothing is estimated. Where a
number was not measured it says so rather than showing a zero.

**Hardware.** RTX 5070 Ti Laptop, 11.94 GB VRAM, compute capability 12.0 (Blackwell, sm_120),
driver 592.01, **95 W enforced power limit**. Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, 32 GB RAM. Windows 11
native (10.0.26200), Python 3.12.10, PyTorch 2.11.0+cu128. **All benchmarks ran plugged in** — the
power figures are meaningless on battery.

**A caveat that applies to every latency number.** `t0` is the moment OpenCV returns the frame, not
true photon arrival. Sensor exposure and USB transport add an unmeasured constant offset, so every
photon-to-answer latency reported here is a **lower bound**.

**A second caveat, specific to this camera.** Left on auto-exposure it trades frame rate for
exposure time as the room darkens — measured 30 → 19.9 → 10 FPS across a single evening, silently.
All benchmark runs pin exposure (`configs/capture/webcam.yaml`); runs whose frames are too dark to
be worth interpreting are flagged `too_dark` in their metrics file.

## 1. The problem, measured (Phase 1)

A VLM call on every frame it can get, `SmolVLM2-500M-Video-Instruct-Q8_0` on llama.cpp CUDA.
Two 60-second runs. Figure: `results/phase1_naive_baseline.png`.

| | live webcam | recorded clip |
|---|---|---|
| capture FPS | 30.40 | 30.28 |
| VLM calls/s | 10.2 | 10.9 |
| **throughput deficit** | **3.0×** | 2.8× |
| frames dropped (policy `drop_oldest`) | 39.8% | 39.0% |
| photon→first-token p50 / p95 | 70 / 92 ms | 69 / 87 ms |
| photon→answer p50 / p95 / p99 | 115 / 138 / 150 ms | 107 / 129 / 136 ms |
| GPU power mean / peak | 65.6 / 103.6 W | 64.6 / 73.3 W |
| **energy per answer** | **6.47 J** | 6.04 J |
| peak VRAM | 1.47 GB | 1.47 GB |

**Per-frame inference is outside the power envelope, not merely slow.** At 6.47 J per answer, a
30 FPS per-frame oracle needs **197 W sustained against a 95 W cap — 2.1× over budget**. Even given
unlimited time, this laptop cannot answer every frame.

This used the *smallest credible* VLM on purpose. A larger model makes the failure trivially true
and easy to dismiss with "use a smaller model"; if even a 500M model cannot keep up, nothing can.

**Per-stage budget (p50).** `capture_read` 32.09 ms (camera-paced) · `vlm_total` 97.66 ms ·
`vlm_encode_jpeg` 0.84 ms · `fast_tier` and `render` ~0.00 ms. The pipeline is genuinely decoupled:
`capture_q` and `answer_q` sit at mean depth 0.00 while `vlm_q` is pinned at its bound.

**There is a ~15 ms scheduling floor on every llama-server call.** Connection pooling removes it
from a bare `GET /health` (15.08 → 0.46 ms p50) but does nothing for completions (15.14 ms fresh
vs 15.58 ms pooled), so it is server-side task scheduling rather than transport.

## 2. The fast tier (Phase 2)

Runs on every frame. Figure: `results/phase2_fast_tier.png`.

### Encoder sweep

Latency includes preprocessing. Quality is scored on how far the embedding moves under three kinds
of change: **lighting** (gamma 0.6/1.6, brightness ±40), **motion** (consecutive frames), and
**semantic** (a synthetic opaque object over ~12% of the frame).

| encoder | p50 ms | p95 ms | sem/light | **sem/motion** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| downsample32 *(control, no network)* | **0.16** | 0.17 | **19.45** | **0.42** ⚠️ |
| **mobilenetv3_small onnx** ← chosen | **3.32** | 4.08 | 12.48 | **4.61** |
| mobilenetv3_small torch fp16 | 5.62 | 6.17 | 12.45 | 4.59 |
| dinov2_vits14 onnx | 4.20 | 4.52 | 15.84 | 2.99 |
| dinov2_vits14 torch fp16 | 5.21 | 5.56 | 15.81 | 2.99 |
| clip_vitb32 onnx | 4.23 | 5.44 | 4.47 | 2.77 |
| clip_vitb32 torch fp16 | 4.72 | 5.88 | 4.46 | 2.77 |

**Both ratios have to be read together.** The control tops `semantic/lighting` at 19.45 purely
because mean-centring and L2-normalising a grayscale thumbnail makes it brightness-invariant *by
construction*. Its `semantic/motion` of **0.42** exposes what it is: it moves further when
something merely moves than when the scene genuinely changes. A single-ratio table would have
selected a motion detector.

**ONNX Runtime beat PyTorch on every candidate** (1.69× MobileNet, 1.24× DINOv2, 1.12× CLIP) with
quality identical to three decimals, as it should be for the same graph.

**The cheapest learned encoder won outright** — no quality-for-speed trade was required.

*Limitation:* 24 frames from one clip, with a synthetic semantic event. Deliberately easy — failing
it means an encoder certainly fails subtle events; passing it does not prove the converse.

### Sustained run

| | |
|---|---|
| achieved FPS (live, 30 s) | **30.65**, 0 frames dropped |
| fast_tier p50 / p95 / p99 | **4.55 / 6.99 / 8.63 ms** |
| unpaced throughput | **211 FPS — 7.0× the requirement** |
| mean GPU power | **8.17 W** (vs 65.6 W answering every frame) |
| peak VRAM | 0.61 GB |

**Watching every frame costs 8.2 W; answering every frame costs 65.6 W and still cannot keep up.**
That 8× gap is the quantitative case for the two-tier architecture.
